                <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>1</sup>My journey growing up began with an interest for drawing.
                    <sup>2</sup>I was drawing using those ballpens my father uses in his job. <sup>3</sup>As soon as
                    they noticed this, crayons and pencils were in my hand in the following moment. <sup>4</sup>Each
                    day, pencils and crayons were my toys which unlocked stories in my imagination. <sup>5</sup>Before I
                    could learn to read and count, boats in the sky, cars in the mountains, upside down waterfalls, and
                    weirdly shaped landscapes were my language. <sup>6</sup>Due to this, I was never the loud or
                    outgoing child in my class. <sup>7</sup>I preferred to stay in corners quietly shaping my next
                    universe without distractions. <sup>8</sup>Before you say I am a loner, I have friends along with
                    me. <sup>9</sup>I still remember the day where I saw that the classroom wall lacked something to
                    which I drew and got scolded. <sup>10</sup>It was one of the moments I realized how much I wanted to
                    create. <sup>11</sup>Around that time I started wearing glasses and made the world look sharper and
                    more detailed than ever. <sup>12</sup>Even those little things; the texture of a tree bark, the way
                    shadows are formed, the waves of the waters, or the grass leaves of the plains, made my drawing a
                    bit more detailed. <sup>13</sup>Every new ideas and observations were on my paper the next second.
                    <sup>14</sup>Over time, I realized that for me, art was never just a hobby of some sorts, but also a
                    way to communicate my ideas, my imagination, feelings if I had one, and thoughts. <sup>15</sup>My
                    sketches became more detailed and more colorful the way how I saw my world. <sup>16</sup>These early
                    experiences gave me confidence in my creative skills and help me understand who I was and what I
                    loved to do. <sup>17</sup>Even as a child, drawing and painting is where I felt the connection to.
                    <sup>18</sup>This connection guided my path throughout my childhood, at present, and towards the
                    future. <sup>19</sup>From those crayons and pencils which I first held, and the ballpen that led me
                    to development, my passion for creating shaped my childhood as a whole. <sup>20</sup>It became a
                    part of who I am.</p>

            <!-- Teenage Years Section -->
            <article id="teenage">
                <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>1</sup>My teenage years were a time of growth and change in my life.
                    <sup>2</sup>I became close to a small group of friends who are also artistic and enjoyed drawing as
                    much as I did. <sup>3</sup>We shared sketches and stories during breaks, filled up sketchbooks,
                    modeled clays, painted canvases, and drew on whiteboards. <sup>4</sup>Although these friendships
                    helped my creativity grow, these things distracted me from my schoolwork. <sup>5</sup>Time after
                    time, teachers reminded me to focus on my studies, but my attention always goes back to my drawings.
                    <sup>6</sup>Over time, our group of artist friends split up due to reasons, but my passion grew
                    stronger than ever. <sup>7</sup>Even quarantine did not stop me from communicating with my friends.
                    <sup>8</sup>Discovering video games became an important turning point for me, not because of
                    addiction, but because on how artwork could come to life through those movement and interactions.
                    <sup>9</sup>I became curious on how these digital worlds were made and how those artistic visuals
                    change. <sup>10</sup>It lead me to programming which felt like discovering a new tool like those
                    pencil and crayons during my first journey. <sup>11</sup>With programming, I could take ideas that
                    had stayed in papers and bring them to life on screen. <sup>12</sup>I spent countless hours trying
                    to figure out how things work, fixing mistakes, and eventually completing a game, although unrefined
                    and cluttered, but it is a game which I am very proud of. <sup>13</sup>Even though I am still
                    struggling in some of my classes during that time, I found my self in pleasure in combining
                    creativity and problem solving. <sup>14</sup>Technology and storytelling became my passion with each
                    stronger than the other. <sup>15</sup>I see visions of the future where I can make my own
                    interactive worlds, share stories beyond just the paper. <sup>16</sup>My years during high school
                    taught me the importance of patience and perseverance as learning new skills was never easy.
                    <sup>17</sup>There were times where I found myself stuck in a problem and thought that was it, but
                    learned to grow and overcome these struggles. <sup>18</sup>There was no AI to talk to so most of the
                    time, forums after forums, documentation after documentation, or tutorials after tutorials, each
                    leading me to find the answer to my problems. <sup>19</sup>Creativity became a part of my identity,
                    one that I am willing to nurture and protect. <sup>20</sup>Each line in a sketch, each variable in
                    a code, and each idea in my imagination contributed to the direction I would eventually take in
                    life.</p>

            <!-- College Section -->
            <article id="college">
                <h2>College Years</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>1</sup>My college experience was unlike what I expected.
                    <sup>2</sup>Unlike other colleagues who lived their lives in this country, for me it was a
                    rollercoaster ride of an experience. <sup>3</sup>Adjusting took me longer than I expected, well not
                    because of the language, but because on how lively the streets are, the darker side of humanity, and
                    how the people live their life in this country. <sup>4</sup>These experiences halted my creativity
                    as survival was the first and foremost importance at the moment. <sup>5</sup>As I adjust to the new
                    environment and my classes, my passion for drawing and technology goes back to me and I started
                    creating more and more games side by side to my classes. <sup>6</sup>College gave me the chance to
                    learn more about digital technologies, software development, new languages, and visual arts in a
                    supportive environment. <sup>7</sup>Throughout my classes, group projects helped me learn how to
                    collaborate with others and appreciate more ideas. <sup>8</sup>Although the group of friends I have
                    right now are not the artistic side, they are now a group of friends that are on the technology side
                    of things. <sup>9</sup>I learned to appreciate this new form of collaboration as much as the quiet
                    artistic moments of my past. <sup>10</sup>Long nights spent debugging code, designing assets,
                    reminded me that creativity can be many forms. <sup>11</sup>Joining organizations to pursue my path
                    as a programmer with creativity, challenging myself to competitions, learning to grow between
                    techstacks are where I am right now. <sup>12</sup>In the past where competitions among artists is
                    where thrived, competitions in technologies are where I pursue with the same determination.
                    <sup>13</sup>Each new project strengthens my problem-solving skills and expands ways I could’ve
                    never have imagined. <sup>14</sup>College has shown me that creativity is best combined with
                    technology. <sup>15</sup>I have learned to be more resilient and patient along with the virtue of
                    effort in the face of challenges. <sup>16</sup>My experiences here have taught me that growth
                    happens outside comfort zones. <sup>17</sup>By balancing academics, personal projects, and
                    collaborative work, I feel that I am going to a path towards becoming a better and more artistic
                    future of myself. <sup>18</sup>I am beginning to understand how to turn my ideas into results that
                    others can also experience. <sup>19</sup>Every success and failures teaches me new things like
                    discipline, creativity, and adaptability. <sup>20</sup>With each projects and each breakthrough, I
                    feel motivated to continue pushing the boundaries of what I can create and accomplish both art and
                    technology.</p>
