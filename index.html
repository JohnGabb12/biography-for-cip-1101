        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
          My journey growing up began with an interest for drawing.<sup>1</sup>
          I was drawing using those ballpens my father uses in his job.<sup>2</sup>
          As soon as they noticed this, crayons and pencils were in my hand in
          the following moment.<sup>3</sup> Each day, pencils and crayons were
          my toys which unlocked stories in my imagination.<sup>4</sup> Before
          I could learn to read and count, boats in the sky, cars in the
          mountains, upside down waterfalls, and weirdly shaped landscapes
          were my language.<sup>5</sup> Due to this, I was never the loud or
          outgoing child in my class.<sup>6</sup> I preferred to stay in
          corners quietly shaping my next universe without distractions.<sup>7</sup>
          Before you say I am a loner, I have friends along with me.<sup>8</sup>
          I still remember the day where I saw that the classroom wall lacked
          something to which I drew and got scolded.<sup>9</sup> It was one of
          the moments I realized how much I wanted to create.<sup>10</sup>
          Around that time I started wearing glasses and made the world look
          sharper and more detailed than ever.<sup>11</sup> Even those little
          things; the texture of a tree bark, the way shadows are formed, the
          waves of the waters, or the grass leaves of the plains, made my
          drawing a bit more detailed.<sup>12</sup> Every new ideas and
          observations were on my paper the next second.<sup>13</sup> Over
          time, I realized that for me, art was never just a hobby of some
          sorts, but also a way to communicate my ideas, my imagination,
          feelings if I had one, and thoughts.<sup>14</sup> My sketches became
          more detailed and more colorful the way how I saw my world.<sup>15</sup>
          These early experiences gave me confidence in my creative skills and
          help me understand who I was and what I loved to do.<sup>16</sup>
          Even as a child, drawing and painting is where I felt the connection
          to.<sup>17</sup> This connection guided my path throughout my
          childhood, at present, and towards the future.<sup>18</sup> From
          those crayons and pencils which I first held, and the ballpen that
          led me to development, my passion for creating shaped my childhood
          as a whole.<sup>19</sup> It became a part of who I am.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
          My teenage years were a time of growth and change in my life.<sup>1</sup>
          I became close to a small group of friends who are also artistic and
          enjoyed drawing as much as I did.<sup>2</sup> We shared sketches and
          stories during breaks, filled up sketchbooks, modeled clays, painted
          canvases, and drew on whiteboards.<sup>3</sup> Although these
          friendships helped my creativity grow, these things distracted me
          from my schoolwork.<sup>4</sup> Time after time, teachers reminded
          me to focus on my studies, but my attention always goes back to my
          drawings.<sup>5</sup> Over time, our group of artist friends split
          up due to reasons, but my passion grew stronger than ever.<sup>6</sup>
          Even quarantine did not stop me from communicating with my
          friends.<sup>7</sup> Discovering video games became an important
          turning point for me, not because of addiction, but because on how
          artwork could come to life through those movement and
          interactions.<sup>8</sup> I became curious on how these digital
          worlds were made and how those artistic visuals change.<sup>9</sup>
          It lead me to programming which felt like discovering a new tool
          like those pencil and crayons during my first journey.<sup>10</sup>
          With programming, I could take ideas that had stayed in papers and
          bring them to life on screen.<sup>11</sup> I spent countless hours
          trying to figure out how things work, fixing mistakes, and
          eventually completing a game, although unrefined and cluttered, but
          it is a game which I am very proud of.<sup>12</sup> Even though I am
          still struggling in some of my classes during that time, I found my
          self in pleasure in combining creativity and problem solving.<sup>13</sup>
          Technology and storytelling became my passion with each stronger
          than the other.<sup>14</sup> I see visions of the future where I can
          make my own interactive worlds, share stories beyond just the
          paper.<sup>15</sup> My years during high school taught me the
          importance of patience and perseverance as learning new skills was
          never easy.<sup>16</sup> There were times where I found myself stuck
          in a problem and thought that was it, but learned to grow and
          overcome these struggles.<sup>17</sup> There was no AI to talk to so
          most of the time, forums after forums, documentation after
          documentation, or tutorials after tutorials, each leading me to find
          the answer to my problems.<sup>18</sup> Creativity became a part of
          my identity, one that I am willing to nurture and protect.<sup>19</sup>
          Each line in a sketch, each variable in a code, and each idea in my
          imagination contributed to the direction I would eventually take in
          life.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p>
          My college experience was unlike what I expected.<sup>1</sup> Unlike
          other colleagues who lived their lives in this country, for me it
          was a rollercoaster ride of an experience.<sup>2</sup> Adjusting
          took me longer than I expected, well not because of the language,
          but because on how lively the streets are, the darker side of
          humanity, and how the people live their life in this country.<sup>3</sup>
          These experiences halted my creativity as survival was the first and
          foremost importance at the moment.<sup>4</sup> As I adjust to the
          new environment and my classes, my passion for drawing and
          technology goes back to me and I started creating more and more
          games side by side to my classes.<sup>5</sup> College gave me the
          chance to learn more about digital technologies, software
          development, new languages, and visual arts in a supportive
          environment.<sup>6</sup> Throughout my classes, group projects
          helped me learn how to collaborate with others and appreciate more
          ideas.<sup>7</sup> Although the group of friends I have right now
          are not the artistic side, they are now a group of friends that are
          on the technology side of things.<sup>8</sup> I learned to
          appreciate this new form of collaboration as much as the quiet
          artistic moments of my past.<sup>9</sup> Long nights spent debugging
          code, designing assets, reminded me that creativity can be many
          forms.<sup>10</sup> Joining organizations to pursue my path as a
          programmer with creativity, challenging myself to competitions,
          learning to grow between techstacks are where I am right now.<sup>11</sup>
          In the past where competitions among artists is where thrived,
          competitions in technologies are where I pursue with the same
          determination.<sup>12</sup> Each new project strengthens my
          problem-solving skills and expands ways I could’ve never have
          imagined.<sup>13</sup> College has shown me that creativity is best
          combined with technology.<sup>14</sup> I have learned to be more
          resilient and patient along with the virtue of effort in the face of
          challenges.<sup>15</sup> My experiences here have taught me that
          growth happens outside comfort zones.<sup>16</sup> By balancing
          academics, personal projects, and collaborative work, I feel that I
          am going to a path towards becoming a better and more artistic
          future of myself.<sup>17</sup> I am beginning to understand how to
          turn my ideas into results that others can also experience.<sup>18</sup>
          Every success and failures teaches me new things like discipline,
          creativity, and adaptability.<sup>19</sup> With each projects and
          each breakthrough, I feel motivated to continue pushing the
          boundaries of what I can create and accomplish both art and
          technology.<sup>20</sup>
