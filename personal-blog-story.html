        <p>
          I look Filipino. Well of course, by blood I am. People speak to me
          like I am a local, every joke, every words, every place. On the
          outside, I just blend easily. But things are different on the
          inside, each experience is something new. Born in a different
          country, I was raised in a place far from the country Philippines,
          and now standing in the same country my parents were born. Every
          second I experience in this country feels like trying to learn a
          culture that was always meant to be mine. It felt like meeting home
          for the first time in my life.

          <b>I am grateful.</b> Grateful for having my tongue used to
          "Tagalog", a language used by Filipinos, while in the country where
          a different culture and language is everywhere. It was something I
          carried with me as it is home-spoken. As I wander through the city
          of Manila, knowing every word spoken, every letter written, and
          every culture heard from stories, is something that feels surreal.
          Unlike feeling home is constrained to a building, everywhere became
          a place of belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I had to learn arriving is the way how people travel.
          First of all, <b>travelling is not my thing</b>, but if it is needed
          then please, let me experience it with someone before I use it
          alone. In my opinion, the first and recommended commute above all
          else for me is using the train than the Jeepneys.
        </p>

        <blockquote>"Para po!"</blockquote>

        <p>
          The word that helped me throughout my commutes. Every time I travel,
          I stare at the GPS maps on my phone and timing my line to stop the
          vehicle. It is a simple word, yes, but it carries weight. Saying it
          too early feels embarrassing, and too late would feel like a
          mistake. Either I try to follow along with others in stop areas, or
          I try to gather myself and say it in the middle of a road where I
          needed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          About the food, doesn't change much. Parents used to cook local
          dishes throughout my life. The thing is that, even if pork is so
          common, I would not get used to it every time it is served to my
          plate. Fried food stalls are second to it. Oily foods are so common
          that it makes me want to just eat vegetables for life. Fresh fishes
          on the other hand are one of the best blessings that this country
          has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I'm not the only one who experienced this especially to those
          friends or comrades that are yet to return, but what I can say is
          that
          <mark>life is an act of adapting. It includes places, culture, and
            people that were always meant to feel like home.</mark>
