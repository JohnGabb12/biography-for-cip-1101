            The future is scary. But one thing that scares me the most is...
            <mark>A JOB APPLICATION.</mark> Touching that <i>thing</i> feels
            like your future is set for slavery. Jokes aside, the future is
            overwhelming. Not having set goals makes the path seems so blurry.
            Its like treading a forest with no destination. You may deviate from
            the path but I'll assure you that it is part of the process.

          <blockquote>What are your future goals?</blockquote>

          <p>
            Makes me think twice before answering. An answer that defines if
            either I'm lying by setting a path to something as long as I have an
            answer, or by playing it cool by saying <q>I don't know</q> and move
            on, or just setting a huge goal and dreaming big with higher risks
            and effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my eighth grade in highschool. Whenever someone asks me what
            is my future goals. I would usually answer software development like
            it is already the path I wanted. I got to know the career itself
            when I was younger. Having to code solutions from problems in either
            games or websites. It makes me feel alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years now in my current career path treading the university
            stride in the course: <mark>Computer Science.</mark> A course that can either put
            you behind Mcdonalds counter or give you a salary slave job where
            both is 24/7. It is a gamble yes. If I deviate from my studies a
            little and the path will close on me. It is like hammering an iron
            over and over without losing concentration that would either fail
            and leave a big dent, or succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future goals? Small stuff. <q>Learn, get experience, graduate.</q> The
            target is to get a tomorrow. As long as the grind is worth it then
            it's fine. The future may be scary but also unfinished. Ask me again
            in a few years and I might say the same thing or maybe something
            completely different.
