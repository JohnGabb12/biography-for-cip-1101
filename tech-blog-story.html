                    Throughout our life as a developer, tinkering and developing applications, fixing coding problems,
                    or anything tech related. You may or may not have heard of <mark>Stack Overflow</mark>. It is an
                    application that
                    helped developers get "unstuck" in their workflow which regarded it as a savior. Modern developers
                    nowadays have never even heard of this so called "Where developers actually learn" as <abbr
                        title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> or <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>
                    became the number one Q&A forum for modern developers.

            <!-- Blog Content -->
            <section class="body">
                The rise of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> and its influence to developers raises the
                big question:
                <blockquote>
                    Does <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> make <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr>
                    irrelevant?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    There were many opinions of this throughout the internet like <q><abbr
                            title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> doesn't kill <abbr
                            title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr></q>, <q>The downfall of contributions to <abbr
                            title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> would actually kill <abbr
                            title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> as well</q>, or <q><abbr
                            title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>'s answers are not as
                        valuable as Stack's</q>, but my answer to that question would be that <mark>it is not about
                        killing
                        Stack, but changing how the developers use it and it's ecosystem.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> itself would not embarrass you like from my
                    experience where every question I ask to Stack would actually be a repost from somewhere 25 years
                    ago
                    and get called out, but in reality, <mark>Stack Overflow's answers are as valuable as an answer in
                        <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> when it comes to more complex programming
                        questions.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a graph released that actually may or may not have answered the question.
                </p>
                <picture class="blog-img">
                    <img src="./assets/tech-blog-story-graph-img.jpg" alt="Stack Overflow Graph">
                </picture>
                <small>Sum of questions and answers posted to Stack Overflow from mid-2008 to April 2025</small>
                <p>
                    The graph itself showcased the number of questions in the life time of <abbr
                        title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> itself. The year when
                    ChatGPT released showed a steep deterioration to the number of questions over the past 2-3 years
                    post-<abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>. This deterioration signaled the inevitable
                    decline where one could not recover from up to the point where they either shut down or sell the
                    site itself for pennies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through out all of these, we may need to slowly not be dependent anymore on <abbr
                        title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> itself before we get affected by its disappearance in the
                    future, but as developers, even if the tools we use will continue to change overtime, the need for
                    the minds of critical thinking will not. While <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> excel
                    at providing fast solutions and <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> with verified solutions and
                    contexts of the problem. <mark>Knowing when to use each of these would become a great skill for
                        modern
                        developers.</mark>
