            The future is scary. But one thing that scares me the most is...
            <mark>A JOB APPLICATION.</mark> Touching that <i>thing</i> feels
            like your future is set for slavery. Jokes aside, the future is
            overwhelming. Not having set goals makes the path seems so blurry.
            Its like treading a forest with no destination. You may deviate from
            the path but I'll assure you that it is part of the process.

          <blockquote>What are your future goals?</blockquote>

          <p>
            Makes me think twice before answering. An answer that defines if
            either I'm lying by setting a path to something as long as I have an
            answer, or by playing it cool by saying <q>I don't know</q> and move
            on, or just setting a huge goal and dreaming big with higher risks
            and effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my eighth grade in highschool. Whenever someone asks me what
            is my future goals. I would usually answer software development like
            it is already the path I wanted. I got to know the career itself
            when I was younger. Having to code solutions from problems in either
            games or websites. It makes me feel alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years now in my current career path treading the university
            stride in the course: <mark>Computer Science.</mark> A course that
            can either put you behind Mcdonalds counter or give you a salary
            slave job where both is 24/7. It is a gamble yes. If I deviate from
            my studies a little and the path will close on me. It is like
            hammering an iron over and over without losing concentration that
            would either fail and leave a big dent, or succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future goals? Small stuff.
            <q>Learn, get experience, graduate.</q> The target is to get a
            tomorrow. As long as the grind is worth it then it's fine. The
            future may be scary but also unfinished. Ask me again in a few years
            and I might say the same thing or maybe something completely
            different.
