            I look Filipino. Well of course, by blood I am. People speak to me
            like I am a local, every joke, every words, every place. On the
            outside, I just blend easily. But things are different on the
            inside, each experience is something new. Born in a different
            country, I was raised in a place far from the country Philippines,
            and now standing in the same country my parents were born. Every
            second I experience in this country feels like trying to learn a
            culture that was always meant to be mine. It felt like meeting home
            for the first time in my life.

            <mark>I am grateful.</mark> Grateful for having my tongue used to
            "Tagalog", a language used by Filipinos, while in the country where
            a different culture and language is everywhere. It was something I
            carried with me as it is home-spoken. As I wander through the city
            of Manila, knowing every word spoken, every letter written, and
            every culture heard from stories, is something that feels surreal.
            Unlike feeling home is constrained to a building, everywhere became
            a place of belonging.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I had to learn arriving is the way how people travel.
            First of all, <mark>travelling is not my thing</mark>, but if it is
            needed then please, let me experience it with someone before I use
            it alone. In my opinion, the first and recommended commute above all
            else for me is using the train than the Jeepneys.
          </p>

          <blockquote>"Para po!"</blockquote>

          <p>
            The word that helped me throughout my commutes. Every time I travel,
            I stare at the GPS maps on my phone and timing my line to stop the
            vehicle. It is a simple word, yes, but it carries weight. Saying it
            too early feels embarrassing, and too late would feel like a
            mistake. Either I try to follow along with others in stop areas, or
            I try to gather myself and say it in the middle of a road where I
            needed to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            About the food, doesn't change much. Parents used to cook local
            dishes throughout my life. The thing is that, even if pork is so
            common, I would not get used to it every time it is served to my
            plate. Fried food stalls are second to it. Oily foods are so common
            that it makes me want to just eat vegetables for life. Fresh fishes
            on the other hand are one of the best blessings that this country
            has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know I'm not the only one who experienced this especially to those
            friends or comrades that are yet to return, but what I can say is
            that
            <q
              >life is an act of adapting. It includes places, culture, and
              people that were always meant to feel like home.</q
