              <h3>Childhood Years</h3>
              <p class="first-paragraph">
                My journey growing up began with an interest for drawing.<sup
                  >1</sup
                >
                I was drawing using those ballpens my father uses in his
                job.<sup>2</sup> As soon as they noticed this, crayons and
                pencils were in my hand in the following moment.<sup>3</sup>
                Each day, pencils and crayons were my toys which unlocked
                stories in my imagination.<sup>4</sup> Before I could learn to
                read and count, boats in the sky, cars in the mountains, upside
                down waterfalls, and weirdly shaped landscapes were my
                language.<sup>5</sup> Due to this, I was never the loud or
                outgoing child in my class.<sup>6</sup> I preferred to stay in
                corners quietly shaping my next universe without
                distractions.<sup>7</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you say I am a loner, I have friends along with me.<sup
                  >8</sup
                >
                I still remember the day where I saw that the classroom wall
                lacked something to which I drew and got scolded.<sup>9</sup> It
                was one of the moments I realized how much I wanted to
                create.<sup>10</sup> Around that time I started wearing glasses
                and made the world look sharper and more detailed than ever.<sup
                  >11</sup
                >
                Even those little things; the texture of a tree bark, the way
                shadows are formed, the waves of the waters, or the grass leaves
                of the plains, made my drawing a bit more detailed.<sup>12</sup>
                Every new ideas and observations were on my paper the next
                second.<sup>13</sup> Over time, I realized that for me, art was
                never just a hobby of some sorts, but also a way to communicate
                my ideas, my imagination, feelings if I had one, and
                thoughts.<sup>14</sup> My sketches became more detailed and more
                colorful the way how I saw my world.<sup>15</sup> These early
                experiences gave me confidence in my creative skills and help me
                understand who I was and what I loved to do.<sup>16</sup> Even
                as a child, drawing and painting is where I felt the connection
                to.<sup>17</sup> This connection guided my path throughout my
                childhood, at present, and towards the future.<sup>18</sup> From
                those crayons and pencils which I first held, and the ballpen
                that led me to development, my passion for creating shaped my
                childhood as a whole.<sup>19</sup> It became a part of who I
                am.<sup>20</sup>

              <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
              <p class="first-paragraph">
                My teenage years were a time of growth and change in my
                life.<sup>1</sup> I became close to a small group of friends who
                are also artistic and enjoyed drawing as much as I did.<sup
                  >2</sup
                >
                We shared sketches and stories during breaks, filled up
                sketchbooks, modeled clays, painted canvases, and drew on
                whiteboards.<sup>3</sup> Although these friendships helped my
                creativity grow, these things distracted me from my
                schoolwork.<sup>4</sup> Time after time, teachers reminded me to
                focus on my studies, but my attention always goes back to my
                drawings.<sup>5</sup> Over time, our group of artist friends
                split up due to reasons, but my passion grew stronger than
                ever.<sup>6</sup> Even quarantine did not stop me from
                communicating with my friends.<sup>7</sup> Discovering video
                games became an important turning point for me, not because of
                addiction, but because on how artwork could come to life through
                those movement and interactions.<sup>8</sup> I became curious on
                how these digital worlds were made and how those artistic
                visuals change.<sup>9</sup> It lead me to programming which felt
                like discovering a new tool like those pencil and crayons during
                my first journey.<sup>10</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                With programming, I could take ideas that had stayed in papers
                and bring them to life on screen.<sup>11</sup> I spent countless
                hours trying to figure out how things work, fixing mistakes, and
                eventually completing a game, although unrefined and cluttered,
                but it is a game which I am very proud of.<sup>12</sup> Even
                though I am still struggling in some of my classes during that
                time, I found my self in pleasure in combining creativity and
                problem solving.<sup>13</sup> Technology and storytelling became
                my passion with each stronger than the other.<sup>14</sup> I see
                visions of the future where I can make my own interactive
                worlds, share stories beyond just the paper.<sup>15</sup> My
                years during high school taught me the importance of patience
                and perseverance as learning new skills was never easy.<sup
                  >16</sup
                >
                There were times where I found myself stuck in a problem and
                thought that was it, but learned to grow and overcome these
                struggles.<sup>17</sup> There was no AI to talk to so most of
                the time, forums after forums, documentation after
                documentation, or tutorials after tutorials, each leading me to
                find the answer to my problems.<sup>18</sup> Creativity became a
                part of my identity, one that I am willing to nurture and
                protect.<sup>19</sup> Each line in a sketch, each variable in a
                code, and each idea in my imagination contributed to the
                direction I would eventually take in life.<sup>20</sup>

              <h3>College Years</h3>
              <p class="first-paragraph">
                My college experience was unlike what I expected.<sup>1</sup>
                Unlike other colleagues who lived their lives in this country,
                for me it was a rollercoaster ride of an experience.<sup>2</sup>
                Adjusting took me longer than I expected, well not because of
                the language, but because on how lively the streets are, the
                darker side of humanity, and how the people live their life in
                this country.<sup>3</sup> These experiences halted my creativity
                as survival was the first and foremost importance at the
                moment.<sup>4</sup> As I adjust to the new environment and my
                classes, my passion for drawing and technology goes back to me
                and I started creating more and more games side by side to my
                classes.<sup>5</sup> College gave me the chance to learn more
                about digital technologies, software development, new languages,
                and visual arts in a supportive environment.<sup>6</sup>
                Throughout my classes, group projects helped me learn how to
                collaborate with others and appreciate more ideas.<sup>7</sup>
                Although the group of friends I have right now are not the
                artistic side, they are now a group of friends that are on the
                technology side of things.<sup>8</sup> I learned to appreciate
                this new form of collaboration as much as the quiet artistic
                moments of my past.<sup>9</sup> Long nights spent debugging
                code, designing assets, reminded me that creativity can be many
                forms.<sup>10</sup> Joining organizations to pursue my path as a
                programmer with creativity, challenging myself to competitions,
                learning to grow between techstacks are where I am right
                now.<sup>11</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the past where competitions among artists is where thrived,
                competitions in technologies are where I pursue with the same
                determination.<sup>12</sup> Each new project strengthens my
                problem-solving skills and expands ways I could’ve never have
                imagined.<sup>13</sup> College has shown me that creativity is
                best combined with technology.<sup>14</sup> I have learned to be
                more resilient and patient along with the virtue of effort in
                the face of challenges.<sup>15</sup> My experiences here have
                taught me that growth happens outside comfort zones.<sup
                  >16</sup
                >
                By balancing academics, personal projects, and collaborative
                work, I feel that I am going to a path towards becoming a better
                and more artistic future of myself.<sup>17</sup> I am beginning
                to understand how to turn my ideas into results that others can
                also experience.<sup>18</sup> Every success and failures teaches
                me new things like discipline, creativity, and adaptability.<sup
                  >19</sup
                >
                With each projects and each breakthrough, I feel motivated to
                continue pushing the boundaries of what I can create and
                accomplish both art and technology.<sup>20</sup>
