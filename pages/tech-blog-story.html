            Throughout our life as a developer, tinkering and developing
            applications, fixing coding problems, or anything tech related. You
            may or may not have heard of <mark>Stack Overflow</mark>. It is an
            application that helped developers get "unstuck" in their workflow
            which regarded it as a savior. Modern developers nowadays have never
            even heard of this so called "Where developers actually learn" as
            <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> or
            <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>
            became the number one Q&A forum for modern developers.

        <section class="body">
          The rise of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> and its
          influence to developers raises the big question:
          <blockquote>
            Does <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> make
            <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr>
            irrelevant?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            There were many opinions of this throughout the internet like
            <q
              ><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> doesn't kill
              <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr></q
            >,
            <q
              >The downfall of contributions to
              <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> would actually kill
              <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> as well</q
            >, or
            <q
              ><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>'s answers are not
              as valuable as Stack's</q
            >, but my answer to that question would be that
            <mark
              >it is not about killing Stack, but changing how the developers
              use it and it's ecosystem.</mark
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Although <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> itself
            would not embarrass you like from my experience where every question
            I ask to Stack would actually be a repost from somewhere 25 years
            ago and get called out, but in reality,
            <mark
              >Stack Overflow's answers are as valuable as an answer in
              <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> when it comes to
              more complex programming questions.</mark
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a graph released that actually may or may not have
            answered the question.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-img-frame">
            <a
              href="../assets/tech-blog-story-graph-img.jpg"
              title="Stack Overflow Graph"
            >
              <picture class="blog-img">
                <img
                  src="../assets/tech-blog-story-graph-img.jpg"

                />
              </picture>
            </a>
            <span>
              Sum of questions and answers posted to Stack Overflow from
              mid-2008 to April 2025
            </span>
          </div>
          <p>
            The graph itself showcased the number of questions in the life time
            of <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> itself. The year when
            ChatGPT released showed a steep deterioration to the number of
            questions over the past 2-3 years post-<abbr
              title="Large Language Models"
              >LLMs</abbr
            >. This deterioration signaled the inevitable decline where one
            could not recover from up to the point where they either shut down
            or sell the site itself for pennies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through out all of these, we may need to slowly not be dependent
            anymore on <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> itself before we
            get affected by its disappearance in the future, but as developers,
            even if the tools we use will continue to change overtime, the need
            for the minds of critical thinking will not. While
            <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> excel at providing
            fast solutions and <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr> with
            verified solutions and contexts of the problem.

              modern developers.</mark
