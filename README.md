1. Georgia's Bakeries
Bread, the 2nd best staple food as an asian, would taste best in bakeries honed with it. One of those bakeries is in Georgia and ofcourse would be a dream to visit. With enough time, money and love for the bread, I would be able to?

2. Tokyo's Comiket
Comiket, also known as Comic Market, is a semiannual convention in Tokyo filled with self-published works. As a person who loves reading instead of watching, this place is a to-go for me.

3. Japan's Konbini
Heard that convenience stores in Japan is too convenient. I want to taste the experience myself so why shouldn't I? Although we already have it anywhere else, why not try the best?

4. Miku Expo 20XX
Felt it the first time it toured in the Philippines. 20XX means that this expo is not just one but many across the globe at every year. Since it is not a static place, why not visit every single time theres an opportunity?

5. Counter Strike Major Tournaments
As a man who played Counter Strike since its golden days, watching every tournaments like a sports channel. It is a dream to go to a tournament as an audience watching the stage itself not limited to the screen.
